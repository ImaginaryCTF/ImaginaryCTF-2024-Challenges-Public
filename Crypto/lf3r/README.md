## Description

LFSR's weakness comes from its linearity, so I come up with a new way to make it non-linear. Can you help me analyze it?

## Distribution

- `chall.py`
- `output.txt`

## Solution

Denote the stream of lsb of state as a binary vector `lfsr_lsb_stream`, there is a matrix $M_2$ over $\mathbb{F}_2$ such that $\text{lfsr\_lsb\_stream} = \text{key\_bits} \cdot M_2$ can be derived from the `MASK`.

Similarly, there is also another matrix $M_3$ over $\mathbb{F}_3$ that $\text{lfsr\_lsb\_stream} \cdot M_3 = \text{output\_ternary\_digits}$. Solving this system over $\mathbb{F}_3$ results result in a 255-dimension affine space of solutions. (i.e. $\text{lfsr\_lsb\_stream} = \text{sol} + t \cdot \text{lk}$)

Since the correct $\text{lfsr\_lsb\_stream}$ have to be binary, and the $\text{sol}$ contains ternary digits, I apply a randomized greedy algorithm to remove the presence of $2$ and it would recover the correct $\text{lfsr\_lsb\_stream}$.

Finally, solve a system over $\mathbb{F}_2$ with $M_2$ recover the key and we can decrypt the flag. See [solve.py](./challenge/solve.py) for details.
