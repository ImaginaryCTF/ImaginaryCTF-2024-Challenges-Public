# BF

# Description
Simple equations... but in BF?!!!

# Distributions
- `challenge/bf.txt`

# Solution

Solve script (for intended) at: `challenge/solve.py` (Super detailed). 
Alternate solution (don't do this): Remove all the `[><]` (They cause the infinite loop) and then use an online bf compiler and give input "i" Let it run and then give "a" (assuming you don't know the next character). You will see that the value currently is "254". You need it to be zero so add ascii value of "a" + 2 and you get "c", which is the right character! Continue doing this. (I don't exactly know how to get rid of the unintended solution. If you do, please send me a message on discord :D)
