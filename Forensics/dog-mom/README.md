Find where this picture was taken; submit your flag as `ictf{latitude_longitude}`, both rounded to three decimal places. (example: `ictf{-12.345_66.533}`)

# Distributions
- `image.png`

# Solution

- Google image search on just the top left corner (cutting out the metal bar) will show that this is the view from the top of the Cathedral of Learning in Pittsburgh, PA. Submit that location as the flag.
